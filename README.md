# HouseDesert

Demo: https://youtu.be/WyP9BGvDTPc

This tool, **house desert** is to be used alongside your house hunting process to inform you how far your favorite stores / restaurants are from your potential new house.  
This gets its name from the term **pharmacy desert**: an area where there is limited or no access to a pharmacy within a reasonable distance.   
The lack of access to a pharmacy in a pharmacy desert can have a significant impact on patients, as it may make it difficult or impossible for them to obtain necessary medications, potentially leading to negative health outcomes.   
Similarly, living far away from something of interest can limit or eliminate the benefits and enjoyment that a person might otherwise experience.   

To use this, you'll need a .env file within the server directory with two variables:  
```
PORT={any port, I used 8080}
API_KEY={your google api key}
```
